## A few words about...

#### Keyboard controls
+ __WASD__: movement
+ __Space__: take/put
+ __Tab__: cut
#### Game logic
Your goal is to cook everything that the guests of the restaurant have ordered.
The _faster you checkout_ your order, the _more tips_ you get.
If you don't manage to checkout the order in time, you will lose a few tips.

Obviously, you should cut the food on a cutting board before trying to cook it.

If you've made the wrong meal, you can use the trash can to clean your utensil. You can also put food in the trash can (_for what reason -___-?_).

When the time is up, the game is over!
